In this folder there are 5 files. Any file with the CoreFluxDensity name must be downloaded for the application to function.

The FluxValuesExcel file is a pre-fromatted excel sheet that has all the tables for values, the graph, etc. The program does not output
into the excel file, however, the output is build around the formatting in that file so if another file is going to be used, the program must 
be edited. The program itself creates a .csv file that can be imported excel. For automatic updates, Visual Basic macros can be used 
(although if that doesn't work I can try using C++ .COM but it will take me a bit of time to set up).

The final file is the program itself because I learned from the last project that having backup copies of any program is important in 
case we need to revert to a previous version.
